# So you have an idea

# Problem
- you have an idea or you look for an idea, how to validate it?
- global idea space internet converges to one solution
- unclear motivation why someone gives you feedback -> mom test
- what aspects of your idea do you want to get feedback for
- don't expect encouragement, expect a beating
- Even nay-sayers can provide good feedback, but filter their answer, wear a helmet

# Solution
- ideas are like plants, when they are small they are fragile and it is hard to imagine,
  how they will look like when grown
- don't ask for feedback too early
-
