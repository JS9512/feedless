# rich-RSS

`rich-RSS` is a API middleware that allows you transform any RSS/ATOM/OPML or JSON feed into a verbose rich feed. `Rich` in this context is an umbrella term for the following features:

- full(-text) feed items
- quality stats
- quantity stats
- media data for embedded videos/audios and images.
- metadata from article site, like title, authors, language

Try the [live demo](https://richrss.migor.org/) it takes you to the [swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). `rich-RSS` can be configured to use the feed generators [rss-proxy](https://github.com/damoeb/rss-proxy) and [rss-bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge), e.g as a fallback for a broken feed.


## Using docker

## Using docker-compose (Recommended)

The recommended way to use rich-RSS is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
